GLSceneVKS v.0.1 alpha
Vulkan Solution for Delphi, C++Builder, Lazarus and Typhon

==========================================================

GLSceneVKS is a Vulkan based 3D library for Delphi, C++Builder and Lazarus. 
It provides visual components and objects allowing description and rendering of 3D scenes in an easy, no-hassle, yet powerfull manner.
GLSceneVKSis not just a Vulkan wrapper or utility library, it has grown to become a set of founding classes for a generic 
3D engine with Rapid Application Development in mind. GLSceneVKS allows you to quickly design and render 3D scenes 
without having to learn the intricacies of Vulkan and OpenGL: if you know how to design a TForm, you'll easily master 
the basic operation of TVKScene. Make sure to checkout the introduction tutorial included in the help folder.
GLSceneVKSincludes more than many components and a variety of founding classes. 
The library comes with a comfortable set of demos showcasing the ease of use and demonstrating that the RAD wasn't done 
at the expense of CPU/GPU horsepower. Advanced demos and samples can be found in the project repository 
at https://sourceforge.net/p/glscene/code/branches/vkscene
The GLSceneVKS Sound System allows positional 3D audio via low-level APIs like FMOD, BASS or OpenAL.

________________________________________

To Install GLSceneVKS follow the instruction in installation directory. To compile VKScene, after having installed all the necessary units 
and updated your environment library paths (and after making sure you have no duplicates or leftover units from other/older packages), 
open and install the package appropriate in the corresponding directory. 
If you checked out from the SVN, compile issues are possible, it's the bleeding edge, and it is not called "bleeding" without reason ;)... 
Otherwise, check your search paths for duplicates or old .pas/.dcu that's where the problem lies 99% of the time.
If you have installed a current version, make sure no files of the previous version remains, some files may have been renamed, 
moved or removed in between versions. Use MassReplace utility to update old version samples to current one.

The code is still copyrighted (in that it isn't public domain), but you can use it in products with closed or open-source freely. 
The only requirements are:
•  Acknowledge GLSceneVKS is used somewhere in your application (in an about box, credits page or printed manual, etc. 
   with at least a link to http://www.sourceforge.projects/glscene
•  Modifications made to GLSceneVKSunits must be made public (no need to publish the full code, only to state which parts were altered, and how), 
   but feel welcome to open-source your code if you so wish.

Some API headers, units and DLLs are included in the GLSceneVKS package for convenience but are not a part of VKScene, 
may use different licensing scheme and have different copyright owners, such files have an explicit notice attached to them or 
placed in their directory.

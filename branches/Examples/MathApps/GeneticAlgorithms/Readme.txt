Genetic Programming pioneer John Koza, a consulting professor in electrical engineering at Stanford, 
has used the method to design circuits, controllers, optical systems and antennas that perform as well as 
or better than those with patented designs. 
He recently was awarded a patent for a controller design created entirely by GP. 

It is, like biological evolution, a slow process. Until recently, computer power was too expensive 
for GP to be practical for complex problems. 
Koza can do simple problems on laptop PCs in a few hours, but the controller design took 
a month on a 1,000-node cluster of Pentium processors. 

"We started GP in the late 1980s, and now we have 1 million times more computer power," Koza says. 
"We think sometime [within] 10 years we ought to be able to play in the domain of real engineers."

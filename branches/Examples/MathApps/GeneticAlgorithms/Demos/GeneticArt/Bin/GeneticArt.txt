GeneticArt uses NEAT (evolvable Neural Networks) to evolve black and white images. The user clicks on the images he likes best and requests a new generation. The system crosses the most popular images with each other, creating  a new generation of images.

Instructions:
Click one one or more images that you like
Click "New Generation" to create a new batch of images

Right Click to either zoom an image, or to enter "Ken's God Mode" where you get to alter the weights of the connections in the neural network.

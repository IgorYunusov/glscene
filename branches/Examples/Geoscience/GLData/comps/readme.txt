Note the latest version of these components should also be found in the glData CVS under the "comps" module.


Installation Notes:

Under Delphi 7 this uses a TActionPopupMenu component. It is recomended you install the Delphi 7.0 unofficial patch for ActionBands if compiling this package or glData in general.

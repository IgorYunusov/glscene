Source Exporter 2.5 for maya 4-7 updated by Prall 

install: 1.	copy all files from the zip to

		%USERPROFILE%/my documents/maya/x.x/
		
		should be something like 

		c:/documents and settings/username/my documents/maya/7.0/

		or use the path from environment variable MAYA_SCRIPTS_PATH
	 
	 
scene:  1.	add a phongE shader with a power of 2 tga texture connected to the color channel to your mesh
		tga must be in materialsrc/models/anyfolder
	2.	to use material options load hl2shader.mel in script editor, select the whole script (ctrl+a)
		file->save selected to shelf and give it a name. u will get a shelf button that creates a phongE shader 
		with some extra atributes. save another copy without the first line to make a update button for existing phongE shaders
	3.	create a "reference" named layer and add the reference mesh to it (with mesh selected rmb click on the layer and select
		"add selected objects" from dropdown.
	4.	do the same for "physics" and if u want breakable model also for "ref_break_01" + "phy_break_01" , "ref_break_02" a.s.o.
		use the create layer gui to get extra attributes for the break layers where you can set individual surfaceprops and mass
	5.	to use skins add the shader names seperated by " " in the skins extra attribute of the base shader
		(example: apply phongE1 to object and set "phongE2 PhongE3" as skins attribute...this will create 3 skins of these 3
		shaders and converts its textures)if u have multiple materials for a model make sure the skin count is the same on
		textures you want to switch (ex. 2 bark textures + 3 branch textures only work if u reuse one of the bark shaders in
		the skin attribute....if u have only 2 it wont switch them, only the 3 branches....this ofcourse doesnt matter if u 
		have just 1 bark texture) 
	


export:	1.	save your scene and use 
		smdOptionWindow (mel command line or file->exportsmd option box) or use the shelf button
	2.	go to paths tab and click default
	3.	click full compile


some notes:
		
	-paths	do not use special chars or spaces
		/sources/scenes/ >> /sources/model_sources/ >> /vproject/models/
		/sources/materialsrc/models/ >> /vproject/materials/models/
	-no undo before export
		save before or maya will crash
	-unique shape names
		do not use dupe shape names
	-steam
		make sure it is running or export wont work
	-textures
		make sure they are tgas with a power of 2 resolution
		you can use bumpmaps or normal maps connected to bump of phonge shader
		just name them *_height or *_normal for correct export







Export Tab Options:
	-export Reference smd from Layer "reference"
		only uncheck if it already exists (to speed recompile)
	-export Physics smd from Layer "physics"
		only uncheck if it already exists (to speed recompile)
	-freeze and reset transforms
		better not use that..freeze transform and reset for every mesh in the scene
	-combine and smooth collision meshes
		collisionmodels seem to need a single node. this combines multiple collision meshes
		and combines them (per layer) and smoothes edges. good if you just copy
		around some primitives as collision model
	-export/compile break models from Layer "ref_break*" and "phy_break*"
		exports break smd's form Layers named "ref_break*" and "phy_break*"
		(ex. ref_break01 phy_break01, ref_break02 phy_break02)
		creates qc's with same settings as base, compiles and adds break commands to base qc 
        -export LOD Models from Layer LOD_range
		creates a LOD model for each Layer called LOD_range where range is the min distance
		for this LOD Model
        -export 1 frame Idle smd
		use it to create dummy animation smd, uncheck if you have your own idle animation in
		Animation Tab. It doesnt affec the dummy idle from break models, just the base model
       	-export Animation smds
		exports Animations set in Animations Tab
	-export Textures
		exports Textures
	-generate QC
		well...what might this do?? ;) uncheck if u want to use your own qc but compile will fail
		if the correct named (scenename.qc) and working qc doesnt exist
	-Compile
		run studiomdl
	-body groups from "reference" Layer
		generates body groups from the reference layer. it uses each mesh as body group with this
		mesh as submodel and a blank one. mesh named "main" will be used as base mesh, if there is
		no mesh named main in the reference layer, base mesh will be the first mesh
		NOTE: gets turned off when using staticprop
	-HLMV Thumbnail
		renders a 640 x 480 jpg from framed perspective view to the mdl location as model icon in HLMV
		makes stuff easier to find ....make sure you have a bright light in scene...
		default turns out too dark







Path Settings:
	-smd/qc Path
		this is the models source path. it must have /model_sources/ in it and /model_sources/
		should be in the same folder as your maya scenes folder
	-texture Path:
		this is the textures source root path. it must have /materialsrc/ at the end, exact paths are 
		take from the Texturefile Nodes (tga)
	-Default
		this resets paths to default. both paths are taken form the scene file path (works only with
		saved scene in /scenes/ dir).  
		NOTE: the target paths are generated from the vproject environment variable and the relative paths
		from texturefile nodes and smd/qc path
QC Settings:
	-Mass
		Mass for collisionmodel in Kilo
	-Staticprop
		sets staticprop in qc, disables seperate body groups, overrides keyvalues 
	-Scale
		guess what...scale factor
	-Surfaceprop
		select what u think might fit
	-keyvalues
		select one from the list
	-add to end of QC File
		anything u write there will be added to the end of base qc file
Animations:
	-Sequence Name
		name of the sequence
	-start frame
		start frame in timeline for this sequence
	-end frame
		end frame in timeline for this sequence
	-add on end
		end of the sequence line...add your framerate, rotation, events, whatever here
	-Add
		adds sequence with current Animation Settings
	-edit
		save Animation Settings changes for selected Sqyuence
	-del
		remove selected sequence

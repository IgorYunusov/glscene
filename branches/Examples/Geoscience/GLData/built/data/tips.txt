The glData homepage is http://gldata.sourceforge.net. The website was created by Graphic Edge Ltd. (http://www.graphic-edge.co.nz).
glData is built with the GLScene graphics library (http://www.glscene.org).  GLScene is the best OpenGL graphics library for Delphi.  
Special GLScene components were built for glData including the TGLArrowLine.
Be sure to check out Dave Kerr's ai.planet project (http://aiplanet.sourceforge.net).
glData is released under the terms of the Mozilla Public Licence. It is therefore open source software.
The 'colour tool' (Tools menu) can be used to create and/or edit a list of identifier-colour combinations.
Almost all program settings can be accessed from the 'preferences' (Tools menu). Settings are stored in the registry for the current user.
Antialiasing (Preferences -> Display) may be supported in your graphics card. 
Antialiasing improves the rendering quality at the cost of reduced interactive performance.
The benchmark, locator, and axes forms can be docked into the main window.
VirtualDub (http://www.virtualdub.org) is a useful program for animation post production.

Always check <a href="http://www.cambrianlabs.com/MineSweeper3D/">http://www.cambrianlabs.com/MineSweeper3D/</a> for the latest version!
<h3>The developer</h3>
The program was created by <a href="mailto:mattias@cambrianlabs.com">Mattias Fagerlund 
(mattias@cambrianlabs.com)</a>, using Borland Delphi 6.0 and <a href="http:\\www.glscene.org">GLScene</a> for the 
3D.<br><br>
It was developed for <a href="http://www.cambrianlabs.com">Cambrian Labs AB</a> to evaluate some 3D technology, and 
has been released with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a>.<br>

<h3>The game</h3>
<p>(For a detailed description, read the documentation of MS MineSweeper, that's included with windows, the rules for Mine Sweeper 3D are the same.)</p>
<p>Left clicking on a tile will turn the tile. If the tile is hiding a mine, the
mine will explode and the game will be lost. If the tile isn't hiding a mine, it
will show the number of mines it neighbours. If there are no mines around the
tile, the space underneath the tile will be empty. You can also do a &quot;wide
turn&quot; or a &quot;wide reveal&quot;. To quote the helpfile from MineSweeper;
&quot;If you have marked all the mines around a numbered square, you can uncover
the remaining squares around&quot;. To do this, you hold down shift while left
clicking on the tile. If you haven't marked all the mines, nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Right clicking on a tile will flag the tile as a mine. After a tile has been
flagged, it can't be turned (left clicked). If you mistakenly flag a tile, you
must right click it again - that will remove the flag. After that, you can turn
the tile.</p>
<p>When all non mine tiles have been revealed, you have won!</p>

<P><STRONG>Life 3.6</STRONG> and the controls. 
<UL><LI>New to Life 3.6: Includes the Delphi source code</UL></LI>
<UL><LI>[September, 2004] New to Life 3.4: 3D Boids and 3D Life (reads .lif files), <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/"><EM>OpenGL®</EM></A> / <A HREF="http://www.glscene.org/"><EM>GLScene</EM></A> replace DirectX, no install program - just unzip the file, only 1 bird song (they were all lousy anyway), many sample Bird and Life files. Program does not require registration - no cost. It is copyright, 3D Boid source is at <A HREF="http://www.caperaven.co.za/"><EM>Cape Raven</EM></A>.</LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE="+2">Life™</FONT>: is an adaption of "the game of Life" (not to be confused with the board game) by  Conway wherein cells live {remain}, multiply {appear} and die {disappear} according to rules.  Life has evolved into 2D Cellular Automata having attributes and on into 3D characters... <A HREF="fractal.html">Fractal 3D™</A> is also interesting.</LI>
<LI>Termites, Ants, and GRF (Grass-Rabbit-Fox) are confined in this life by 2D existence. Birds still needs development of a 3D shape editor with coloring capability. Dolphins, Mazed Mobiles and Torso do not really exist.  per Reynolds, the design is under construction in Birds, when developed, the extension of behavior to Locomotive characteristics in Bird wing-flapping and body movement-locomotion in Fish while Bods will achieve goal setting to solve the maze of life. All are to become OpenGL® 3D animals packaged as a zip file. Unzip it in a directory of choice and make a shortcut... no installation program... delete the directory when your interest in life dies.
<BR>3.3 uses DirectX and an Install program... the actual program is ~1.2M, ~300k is due to Bird songs included within the program.</LI>

<A HREF="http://www.brunel.ac.uk/depts/AI/alife/alife-main.html">Vants</A>: Langton also created creatures called Vants, or virtual ants. These were V-shaped constructs that moved in the direction of their points. If the lead cell moved into a blank square on an imaginary grid, the vant continued moving in that direction. If the square was blue, the vant turned right and changed the colour of the cell to yellow. If the square was yellow, the vant turned left and changed the colour of the square to blue. Thus the vant left a trail behind it.</P>

<UL><LI> New to Fractal 3D 3.4: Released Delphi source code. Probably EOL for this program, OBE. See <A HREF="index.html">main page</A> for current progress in similar programs.</LI></UL>

No install program - create a directory, unzip the file into the directory and create a shortcut to it. Uninstall by deleting the directory.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 18pt">Fractal 3D 3.1 contains a main display area, and a menu that activates 4 main forms.</SPAN> The forms are: Preview, Fractals, XYZ 3D, and Math Graphics.</P> 


<P>
Fractal has evolved from AVGAFRAK (when it took 24 hours to do a 640x480 fractal on a 8 Mhz computer with a 8087 chip) to Fractal 2d to Fractal 3D and will evolve into Fractal 4D sometime after 3D gains GL 3D capability. Currently it is minimally 3D and though I liked the Fractal interface at some time (when it was more important to keep track of the parameters) it is in need of 'preview mode' fractal selection.  Everything needs a 3D button added and a 'roam through the 3D object' capability... Maybe someday these 'objects' will be exportable into SOS MAP.  The DIY needs work, yet is not going to become a 3D realm... simply atrophy as one of the 2D bitmap adventures.
<BR>The menu allows selection of Image size and colors. Fractal forms are: Preview, Fractals, XYZ 3D, and Math Graphics. The Preview form allows rapid Mandelbrot-Julia and Phoenix-Egg views. Fractal sets and points can be selected on the Fractal form. DEMs are imported-created, tiled, and displayed from the XYZ 3D form on the main screen or a GL viewer. Math Graphics provides Strange attractors, iteration maps, 'Turtle curves', and a Do It Yourself (DIY) composition. DIY'compositions can be 'assembled' through placing graphic objects onto the 'canvas'. Sub-compositions can also be loaded together to form compositions. The help file explains the options and actions, 'popup' and help comments are linked to buttons, selection, and input areas. Forms 'remember' where they were placed and the last directory used by storing project options in fractal.pof. <A HREF="f3dlife_faq.html">F3DLife FAQ Frequently Asked Questions, and To Do list</A>
